			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a Feathercoin URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the Feathercoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with Feathercoin addresses or Feathercoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many Feathercoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay and the fee you are offering.
			Currently, a minimum fee of LTC 0.01 is recommended in order to get your transaction processed.  With large transactions, even this may not be enough.  Development is currently in progress to compute the correct fee for you when sending coins using this interface.  Look forward to it in new releases!
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a transaction while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of Feathercoin Wallet.
			If you want a transaction to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN) and have good Feathercoin connectivity (see Feathercoin connectivity indicator in left notification area).
		</p>
		<p>
			Note:
			Transactions cannot be undone!
			Always check the receiving address.
